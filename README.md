# Client-Server-Development
1. Applying database systems concepts and principles in the development of a client/server application 
2. Developing client-side code that interfaces with databases

Client Background
Grazioso Salvare identifies dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. When trained,
these dogs are able to find and help to rescue humans or other animals, often in life-threatening
conditions. To help identify dogs for training, Grazioso Salvare has reached an agreement with a nonprofit agency that operates five animal shelters in the region around Austin, Texas. This non-profit
agency will provide Grazioso Salvare with data from their shelters.
Grazioso Salvare has noted that there are specific types and breeds of dogs to train. For instance,
search-and-rescue training is generally more effective for dogs that are no more than two years old.
Additionally, certain breeds of dogs are proficient at different types of rescue, such as water rescue,
mountain or wilderness rescue, locating humans after a disaster, or finding a specific human by tracking
their scent.
Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that can work with existing data from the animal
shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. Global Rain has contracted for a full stack
development of this application that will include a database and a client-facing web application
dashboard. Grazioso Salvare will use this dashboard to interact with and visualize data from a MongoDB
database. The dashboard must be a user-friendly, intuitive interface that will reduce user errors and
training time.

Dashboard Branding
To meet Grazioso Salvare’s branding requirements, the company has requested the inclusion of the
following components somewhere on the dashboard:
1. The Grazioso Salvare logo. The company has requested that this logo include a URL anchor tag
to the client’s home page: www.snhu.edu.
2. A unique identifier (text or image) containing your name. Grazioso Salvare would like to credit
you as the creator of the dashboard.

Required Dashboard Widgets
Grazioso Salvare is requiring the following widgets for the dashboard interface:
• Interactive filter options (buttons, drop-downs) to filter the Austin Animal Center Outcomes
data set by:
○ Water Rescue
○ Mountain or Wilderness Rescue
○ Disaster Rescue or Individual Tracking
○ Reset (returns all widgets to their original, unfiltered state)
• A data table which dynamically responds to the filtering options
• A geolocation chart and a second chart of your choice (such as a pie chart) that dynamically
respond to the filtering options

Interactive Filter Options: Required Functionality
Grazioso Salvare needs the ability to filter the data and have the dashboard widgets respond to this
data. The interactive options you create should run queries on the database to gather the required data.
The four interactive options must allow a dashboard user to retrieve data related to the types of rescue
Grazioso Salvare performs:
• Water Rescue
• Mountain or Wilderness Rescue
• Disaster or Individual Tracking
• Reset (returns all widgets to their original, unfiltered state)
When one of the interactive options is selected, the interactive data table, the geolocation chart, and
your second chart must update to show the selected data.
